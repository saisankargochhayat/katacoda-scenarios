In this workshop you learnt how to manage Jupyter Notebook dependencies as an author of the notebook. Using the Thoth Jupyter dependency manager, you were able to embed dependencies into the notebooks and hence turn them into stand-alone units. The notebooks, at this point, can easily be turned into `Jobs` or `CronJobs` or shared with others.
