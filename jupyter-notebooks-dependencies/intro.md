Prerequisite courses:

- [Building Custom Notebook Images]
- [Deploying JupyterHub as a Service]

This course is a continuation of courses [Building Custom Notebook Images] and [Deploying JupyterHub as a Service] and it is therefore recommended to take a look at these first.

In this workshop you will learn how to turn Jupyter Notebooks into a self-contained pieces of code including dependencies by using Thoth Jupyter dependency manager. Eventually, you'll be able to turn these notebooks into for example `CronJob`s or share them with others easily.

You don't need a Git Hub repository. All you need is a Jupyter Notebook.
