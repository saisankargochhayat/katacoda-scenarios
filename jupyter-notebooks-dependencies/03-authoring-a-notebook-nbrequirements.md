### Jupyter NBRequirements

<p align="justify">

This extension is a Jupyter Notebook dependency manager which provides control over the notebook dependencies.

</p>

The main goals of the project are the following:

- To create a notebook with its requirements embedded within it without leaving the notebook
- To provide a unique and optimized<sup>*</sup> environment for each notebook
- To allow for easy sharing, deployment and execution of Jupyter notebooks

The requirements are resolved using pipenv (default) or resolved AND optimized using [Thoth](https://thoth-station.ninja/) resolution engine.
