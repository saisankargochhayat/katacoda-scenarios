Thamos CLI runs based on the `.thoth.yaml` config, which we ahve setup already in the example repository here. 

You can browse the same in the editor or via terminal using -

``cat .thoth.yaml``{{execute}} 

Now we are ready to do ask Thoth for Advise -

``thamos advise``{{execute}}

Tip - ``thamos advise --force`` runs the CLI without cache.

Be a little patient here, this takes some time. After this is done you should see - 
![thamos advise result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saisankargochhayat/katacoda-scenarios/master/thamos-cli/assets/thamos_advise_result.png)

If you see the folder you would see a new file `requirement.txt` has been generated by Thoth.

You can check both the files `requirements.in`, which has direct dependencies. 

``cat requirements.in``{{execute}}

And `requirements.txt`, which has dependencies along with digests - 

``cat requirements.txt``{{execute}}

You can check this out in the editor also. 

Now lets try running the application after installing the depedendencies -

``python3 -m venv venv``{{execute}}

Then we jump into this environment - 

``source venv/bin/activate``{{execute}}

And install the depedencies then - 

``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``{{execute}}

And finally, run the application (the virtual environment needs to be still activated):

``python3 ./app.py``{{execute}}

You should find this at the end - 

`Hello Thoth by TensorFlow!`

To inspect the log of the Thoth Advise process checkout -
``thamos log``{{execute}}
